### 💡 About Me

> 🧠 "Code with precision. Ship with swagger."

Hi, I’m **Shamim** – Hi, I’m Shamim, a software engineer deep in data, APIs, and the chaotic good vibes of databases and queues..  
From crafting RESTful services with Laravel, Node.js & Django, to deploying Dockerized containers into the cloud, I build things that *just work*.  
Currently leveling up in machine learning, with a focus on real-world impact  ( sign language recognition ✌️).
